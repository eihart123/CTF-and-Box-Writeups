# CTF Challenge Portfolio

This repository contains Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges I’ve authored or solved, organized by event.  
Each challenge is designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities, adversary scenarios, or creative exploitation logic.

## Highlights

- [Supermassive Black Hole](): a web challenge focusing on SMTP smuggling. Release date: August 9 2025.
- [The Weakest Link](https://github.com/eihart123/CTF-and-Box-Writeups/blob/main/CTFs/UIUCTF-2024/3-TheWeakestLink.md): The culmination of my UIUCTF 2024 OSINT suite focused on an access control quirk in Spotify.
- [Frame](https://github.com/eihart123/CTF-and-Box-Writeups/blob/main/CTFs/UIUCTF-2022/Frame.md): A retrospective of an older web challenge of mine focused on a file upload vulnerability.
